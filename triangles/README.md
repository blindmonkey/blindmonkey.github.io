# Triangle Visualization

This is a small interesting visualization that I built after I was inspired by the wonderful game [Kami 2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kami-2/id1133161444?mt=8).

The code is currently quite messy, and could use some refactoring.


## Building

To set up the environment, go into the `triangles/` directory, and run `npm install`. This will install all the necessary dependencies into the local `node_modules` folder. You'll likely also need to install `typescript` and possibly some other things that I forgot about. Eventually I'll update this readme to reflect all required dependencies.

To build, run `npm run build` or `npm run watch` to continuously build as files change.
